## Items to Discuss

### Discuss Issue [#164](https://github.com/laminas/technical-steering-committee/issues/164) - Communicating the status of components to users

[@visto9259](https://github.com/visto9259) raises a good [issue](https://github.com/laminas/technical-steering-committee/issues/164) on the TSC repository. Effectively there is a lack of communication with users about the status of all components/libraries.

What can we do to improve the visibility of maintenance decisions for consumers?
