## Items to Discuss

## Api-Tools related ( proposed by Dotkernel organisation)

- continuation of discussion from April 2023
  
    https://github.com/laminas/technical-steering-committee/blob/main/meetings/minutes/2023-04-03-TSC-Minutes.md

What was changed in Dotkernel organisation related to API
- there is a new dedicated website only for Dotkernel API, which is our main focus [dotkernel.org ](https://www.dotkernel.org/)
- there is now a compiled documentation, up to date, for the API and all components and libraries [docs.dotkernel.org ](https://docs.dotkernel.org/)
- it was integrated the CI from laminas flow in all components and libraries [laminas-continuous-integration ](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/laminas-continuous-integration)
- all above are still work in progress, in beta stage

  ### Proposal
  1. mark **api-tools** and all its components as archived in packagist and in github 
  2. remove **api-tools** from [getlaminas.org ](https://getlaminas.org/)
  3. replace **api-tools** with *Dotkernel API* on getlaminas.org website
     **OR** 
  4. recommend *Dotkernel API* as a replacement for **api-tools**

## Business presence 

Right now it seems that the website *getlaminas.org* as a presentation website look kind of rusty and not updated.
Dotkernel team  can allocate few hours of development and design on it. 
   
- Referring to this project, where there are some *Draft* ideas https://github.com/orgs/laminas/projects/23
- Also I want to push this RFC for approval:  https://github.com/laminas/getlaminas.org/issues/162
- And few more business related ideas which I can add to the above RFC afterwards
