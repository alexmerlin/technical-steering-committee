### PHPCS is being abandoned/forked

For more context, [this issue](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/issues/3932) by [@jrfnl](https://github.com/jrfnl) effectively announces the fork and the probable (?) abandonment of the source package.

[Slevomat CS has indicated they will switch to the fork](https://github.com/slevomat/coding-standard/issues/1640).
