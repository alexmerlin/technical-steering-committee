## Items to Discuss

### Archive/Abandon [Laminas Oauth](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-oauth) by [@gsteel](https://github.com/gsteel)

I don't believe we have the resources to maintain this lib.
It is tightly coupled to dependencies that are all aging and mostly archived or in `security-only` mode such as `http`, `math`, `crypt`, `loader`, `config`, `uri`.

### Financing of the Book "Mezzio Essentials"

I would like to discuss the financing of the book "Mezzio Essentials" by Matthew Setter.
I think it would be a good idea to support this project and I see two options:

1. We finance a new version, and with every sale the project receive a share of the revenue.
2. We finance the entire book and is free for everyone.

The biggest question is if Matthew Setter is willing to write a new version of the book and has the time to do so.
