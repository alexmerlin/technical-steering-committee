## Items to Discuss

### Proposal to abandon and archive [laminas-twitter](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-twitter)?

George Steel asks, is it feasible to continue to support this library now that read access is a paid only feature?

`laminas-twitter` also depends on `laminas-crypt` which may or may not be considered for abandonment too.
