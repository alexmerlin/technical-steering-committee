### Move settermjd/laminas-static-pages under Laminas

Matthew Setter would like to move his project, [settermjd/laminas-static-pages](https://github.com/settermjd/laminas-static-pages), under the Laminas organisation. To summarise the package:

> It simplifies rendering static pages in Mezzio applications, avoiding the need to create handlers and handler factories to render static content templates. 

While he is happy to keep maintaining the package personally, he thought that it would be a good addition to the Laminas project.
