## Items to Discuss

- Adoping a code coverage tool: I'm a big fan of using CodeCov in my work/personal projects mainly because it fails CI if project or patch coverage declines. I accept the coverage is not the best quality metric in the world, but the PR comments from CodeCov _(Which I'm most familiar with)_ provide pretty swift feedback on submitted codeâ€¦ I'm fairly confident that you can install the CodeCov app org wide and a token is not required for upload with public repos, theoretically meaning that the martix action could be updated to collect and upload coverage for all repos without any adjustment on a per-repository basis.
