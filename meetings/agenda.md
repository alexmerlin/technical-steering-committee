## Items to Discuss

### Unification of efforts in developing an API application based on Mezzio

We are actively developing, maintaining and using in production a simple REST API project , built around Mezzio API skeleton proposed by 
@ezimuel 5 years ago. 

The repository is here : https://github.com/dotkernel/api


What if we join the efforts,  Laminas and Dotkernel, to have only one production-ready REST API , and build from there a replacement of 
laminas-api-tools.

I am ready to move the repository under Mezzio organisation, and provide part time developers to handle the future development.
